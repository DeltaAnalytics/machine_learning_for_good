    "Feature Engineering is the process of transforming raw data into features/input variables that are easily digested by algorithms. People think that data scientists often spend most of their time testing out various algorithms; however, the majority of performance gains generally come from well-crafted features. \n",

    "__What drives the loan amount requested by KIVA borrowers?__\n",
