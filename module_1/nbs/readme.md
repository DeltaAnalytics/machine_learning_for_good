### Module 1: Introduction to Exploratory Analysis

## Overview

Welcome to the first module! In this series of notebooks, we start exploring our [Kiva](https://www.kiva.org/) dataset. The goal of exploratory analysis is to summarize the main characteristics of a data set, with the belief that it may lead to new hypotheses that inform algorithm choice and experimentation. Exploratory analysis happens before formal modelling commences, and is extremely important for helping inform or sharpen your hypothesis.
