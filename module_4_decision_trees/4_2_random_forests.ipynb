    "\n",
    "Following on from Lab 4.1: Decision trees, the Random Forest algorithm is based on Decisions Trees and can be used for either regression or classification tasks. To overcome Decisions Trees tendancy to overfit, Random Foreasts aggregate the results from many decision trees with an [ensemble approach](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we focus on Random Forests, which use bagging to prevent overfitting by only allowing a given decision tree to optimize for a random subset of the data for every tree, and a random subset of the input features at every split. (Don't worry if this does not make too much sense right now, we'll work through together  😀). \n",
